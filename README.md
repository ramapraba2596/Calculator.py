# Calculator.py
This project is a simple calculator built using Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is menu-driven, uses functions for better code organization, allows repeated calculations using a loop, and handles division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
